## Hi there! 
I'm a master's student of computer science at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology!](https://www.kth.se/)

#### Some things I've worked on! 

* 👩🏾‍💻Unity LiDAR Toolkit - ([Repo](https://github.com/Wessl/LiDAR-Toolkit), [Video])(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB-0QVYpUpk) - Highly customizable & efficient point cloud viewer/simulator. Uses burst, jobs and GPU based rendering to make it efficient. Feel free to download and try it!

* 🌱[Procedural Vegetation Distribution](https://github.com/Wessl/dd2470project/blob/main/README.md) - Places plants procedurally across a Unity terrain, taking moisture, height, slope, etc into account!

* 🛡️[enterpriselang](https://github.com/mal-lang/mitreattacklang) - Meta Attack Language based on the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix. 

* ⚡[LiDAR Game](https://github.com/Wessl/LiDAR-game) - A game I made to explore efficient point cloud generation & rendering on the GPU, made in Unity/C#/HLSL! 

* 🕳️ [Procedurally Generated Tunnel Exploration Game](https://github.com/Wessl/TunnelMesh) - Enjoy a freaky, psychedelic descent into madness. Musically reactive environment! 

* 🏍️ [Line Rider Clone](https://github.com/Wessl/LineRiderClone) - A Unity replication of the popular online game Line Rider! Unleash your creativity and ride the line(ghtning)!
