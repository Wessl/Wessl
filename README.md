### Hi there! Here are some things I've worked on! 

- [Procedural Vegetation Distribution](https://github.com/Wessl/dd2470project/blob/main/README.md) - place plants procedurally across a Unity terrain, taking moisture, height, slope, etc into account!

- [enterpriselang](https://github.com/mal-lang/mitreattacklang) - Meta Attack Language based on the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix. 

- [Ballast](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/ballast) - a game I made together with [Ottos8](https://github.com/Ottos8/) during the 72 hour game jam LDJAM 49! 

- [Relaxing Sarlacc Experience](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/relaxing-sarlacc-experience) - another game I made together with [Ottos8](https://github.com/Ottos8/), made during LDJAM 46! 
 
Also:

The games I've released can be found on my [itch](https://wesslo.itch.io/) profile,

And while I haven't touched it in a long while, here's my [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/love-wessman) profile.
